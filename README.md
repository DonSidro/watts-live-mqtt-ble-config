#  Watts Live MQTT BLE Config

A cross-platform desktop tool to configure **Watts Live** IoT devices over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** and monitor **MQTT messages** in real time.

This app allows you to scan for BLE-enabled Watts Live devices, enter MQTT connection credentials, write them to the device, and optionally connect to your MQTT broker to view live measurement messages.

---

##  Features

-  Scan for nearby **BLE devices** (e.g., “Watts Live”)
-  Connect and write **MQTT configuration** to the device:
  - Hostname  
  - Port  
  - Username  
  - Password
-  Subscribe to an MQTT topic automatically:
  - Uses a **Serial Number** entered by the user  
  - Topic format: `watts/<serial_number>/measurement`
-  Built-in **Activity Log** to display:
  - BLE connection status  
  - Write progress  
  - Live MQTT messages
-  **Modern, dark-themed GUI** built with [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap)
-  Input validation with real-time feedback and friendly error highlights
-  Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

##  Building a Standalone App

You can bundle this app into a standalone `.exe` (Windows) or `.app` (macOS) using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/):

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed watts_live_gui.py
```

Optionally include an app icon:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=watts_live.ico watts_live_gui.py
```

After building, the executable will appear in the `dist/` folder.

This page answers common questions about **watts-live-mqtt-ble-config**.

#### **Q: What is this project?**
#### **A:**  A simple python tool that lets you change the Characteristic UUID values of the Watts Live module enabling MQTT
--
#### **Q: Why was this project created?**
#### **A:**  To take away the need of using an mobile app for manually changing the Characteristic UUID values and simplyfy the process.
--
#### **Q: Who is this project for?**
#### **A:**  The user that wants to integrated the Watts Live module into Home Assistant or other Smart Home systems.
--
#### **Q: Where do I get user/password from?**
#### **A:**  If you are using HAOS and Mosquitto add-on the user/password will be the as your HA user/password (it's recomended to create an MQTT user).
If you are using HA Container user/password are set in the config file inside the Mosquitto container (password.txt).
